Data Mining II project report (Academic year 2023-2024)

## **Module 1: Data Understanding and Preparation**  
- Exploration and preprocessing of tabular and time-series datasets  
- Creation of new variables and selection of relevant features  
- Preparation of time-series data for clustering, anomaly detection, and classification  
- Use of approximation techniques (e.g., SAX, PAA) for large datasets  

## **Module 2: Motifs, Discords, and Clustering**  
- Identification and visualization of motifs and anomalies  
- Application of at least two clustering algorithms with appropriate distance metrics  
- Cluster analysis using dimensionality reduction techniques  

## **Module 2: Classification**  
- Definition of classification tasks and implementation using:  
  - KNN with multiple distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, DTW)  
  - Shapelets-based classification and analysis  
  - Additional classification method (e.g., Rocket, MUSE, CNN, RNN)  

## **Module 3: Outlier Detection and Imbalanced Learning**  
- Detection of top 1% outliers using three different methods from distinct families  
- Visualization and handling of outliers (removal or treatment as missing values)  
- Definition and resolution of an imbalanced classification task using Decision Tree or KNN  
- Implementation of at least two imbalanced learning techniques (undersampling, oversampling)  

## **Module 4: Advanced Classification and Regression**  
- Classification using advanced methods: Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks, Ensemble Methods, Gradient Boosting Machines  
- Hyperparameter tuning and justification of parameter choices  
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and other relevant metrics  
- Discussion of model insights (e.g., overfitting in Neural Networks, impact of base models in Ensemble Methods, feature importance in Random Forests)  
- Multiple regression analysis using two advanced approaches and comparison based on appropriate metrics  
- Application of explainability techniques (e.g., TREPAN, LIME, SHAP, Counterfactual Explainers) to interpret classification results
